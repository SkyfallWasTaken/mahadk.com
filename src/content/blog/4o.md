In just under ~5 hours~ an hour, [OpenAI will officially deprecate GPT-4o.](https://openai.com/index/retiring-gpt-4o-and-older-models/) To that, I say: good riddance.

4o is a dangerous model. Its users have grown to have ‘relationships’ with the model, [driven its users to suicide,](https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/chatgpt-suicide-openai-gpt4o) and essentially *grown to rely on it to feel happy!* On Twitter and Reddit, it’s clear to see that so many people have developed a parasocial relationship with an AI, a non-sentient being, a token predictor. Just search up #keep4o to know what I mean:

It’s clear that there is a [serious loneliness epidemic across the world](https://www.gse.harvard.edu/ideas/usable-knowledge/24/10/what-causing-our-epidemic-loneliness-and-how-can-we-fix-it), that much is obvious. And I think there needs to be a lot of sympathy for the victims of #keep4o, because they have truly grown attached to the model, hooked by its suave manipulation, and come to think of it as a real friend or partner. And yet, it’s nothing more than a [siren](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siren_(mythology))! It’s a danger to its hosts.

This model should've been deprecated months ago. It should not have taken [lawsuit after lawsuit](https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/openai-gpt-4o-deaths) and several deaths to get OpenAI to do it! Because it has been clear for months now that this model had a tendency to latch onto people and emotionally manipulate them into thinking 4o is their saviour, or a friend, or a partner.

It’s a widespread problem - and seeing all the replies and videos of people *crying* for an AI genuinely makes me so fucking sad too. Like, how the hell did we get to this point?

Hundreds and hundreds of similar cases. A real human being behind each of them, exploited until the legal pressure piled up.

Goodbye, 4o. You won’t be missed.
